# Eng-s-OpenML-V2
Creating support for GPU accelerated Matrix Multiplications, this time with NumPy Support for ease of use. 


Supported Operations are based in NumPy, and so it will be a requirement for downloading this library. 

Supported Operations:
- Matrix Multiplication
- Matrix-Vector Multiplication
- Element-wise Operations
- Transpose
- Inverse
- Determinant
- Eigenvalues/Eigenvectors
- Singular Value Decomposition
- Trace
- Frobenius Norm
